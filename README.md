# 🤖 Robotic Hand Mimicry System

## Overview

This project is a **Robotic Hand Mimicry System** designed to replicate the finger movements of a human user in real time using a sensor-equipped glove. It acts as a physical **telepresence hand**, ideal for applications like remote manipulation, education, or accessibility tools.

The system uses **flex sensors** embedded in a glove worn by the user to detect finger bends. These signals are then sent to a microcontroller, which drives **servo motors** connected to a **3D-printed robotic hand** using fishing line or rope to replicate tendon movement. As the user moves their hand, the robotic hand mimics the motion—like a simplified haptic glove without VR integration.

## ✨ What It Does

- Mimics real-time finger movement of a user's hand
- Uses a glove fitted with flex sensors
- Flex sensors detect bending and send signals to control servos
- Servos are attached to each finger joint using rope/fishing line to simulate tendons
- The robotic hand mirrors the human hand's movement almost instantly

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Flex sensors** detect the degree of bending when the user curls or extends a finger.
2. Each sensor sends a varying voltage to the microcontroller based on how much it's bent.
3. The microcontroller reads this voltage and maps it to a corresponding servo motor angle.
4. **Fishing line** connects each servo to its respective 3D-printed finger joint, creating lifelike finger movement.
5. As the glove hand moves, the robotic hand mirrors the movement in real-time.

## 🖥️ Setup Instructions

1. **Connect flex sensors** to analog inputs on your Arduino.
2. **Connect servos** to PWM pins.
3. **Upload the Arduino sketch** (`robotic_hand.ino`) from the `/arduino` folder.
4. Power the system and wear the glove — the robotic hand should now mimic your hand movements.
